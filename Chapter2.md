Before Git was published, SVN(SubVersion) was the main version management system in development industry. Big difference between Git and SVN is that. Git does not save the changes in the commit, but saves the whole code. 

It sounds Git is much slower than SubVersion. In fact, it is opposite, because when there were multiple commits such as 100, and wish to move to the first ccommit, we must calcuate 100 differences. This computation is unnecessary as Git saves the snapshot.
